# Technical Configurations Repository ⚙️

This directory contains sample technical configuration files (JSON and YAML) representing the "Current State" of the infrastructure.

## 🔍 Audit Target

These files are used as input for the engine to demonstrate:

- **Misconfigurations:** Rules that deviate from the administrative intent.
- **Security Gaps:** Violations of **Least Privilege** and **Network Segmentation**.
- **Compliance Failures:** Lack of encryption or MFA requirements in the technical setup.

_Note: Some files are intentionally misconfigured to test the AI's detection capabilities._
